This project is a responsive, multi-page website for a fashion design service. It enables users to start new designs, browse professional patterns, view a community gallery, manage their accounts, and access support—all within a clean, elegant UI.

## 🎨 Design & Style

- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** The UI uses a lot of whitespace, subtle shadows, and a color palettefor for a professional, approachable look.
- **Consistent Branding:** The logo, hero images, and color gradients reinforce a cohesive brand identity across all pages.
- **Typography:** Uses [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) for a modern, readable feel. Headings are bold and large, while body text is light and easy to scan.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Large hero banners, clear section headings, and card-based layouts guide users naturally through the content.

## 🖥️ UI & UX Choices

- **Navigation:** A fixed, responsive navbar ensures easy access to all main sections. The "Start Design" link is visually emphasized to guide new users.
- **Hero Sections:** The main page features a hero banner with a strong call-to-action, engaging users immediately.
- **Cards & Accordions:** Cards are used for services, patterns, and gallery items, providing a tactile, interactive feel. Accordions in the support page make FAQs easy to browse.
- **Interactive Buttons:** Custom button styles with animated borders and hover/click effects enhance engagement and feedback.
- **Responsive Design:** All layouts adapt gracefully to mobile and desktop, using Bootstrap’s grid and custom media queries.
